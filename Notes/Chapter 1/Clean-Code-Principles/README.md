# Clean Code Principles
When developing software, several principles guide us to ensure the code output is clean and of high quality. These principles include:

1. **Maintainability**: It guides us to write code that is easy to understand and to amend when necessary.
2. **Dependability**: The reliability of the code remains unshaken under different conditions.
3. **Efficiency**: The code responds fairly quickly without unnecessarily consuming memory resources.
4. **Usability**: The code is user-friendly, easy to understand, and use without complications.

The recipe for clean code is **Simple-Readable-Concise**.

# Refactoring
This concept calls for the continuous restructuring of the code to improve its internal structure without necessarily changing its external functionality. The purpose is to make the code cleaner and of higher quality. 

## Why Refactor?
There are numerous benefits to refactoring, including:
- Reduces workload in the long run.
- Makes the code easier to maintain.
- Allows you to reuse more of your code.
- Helps in personal development as a better developer.

# Efficient Code
Efficient code can be characterized by:
- Reducing run time.
- Reducing space in memory.

# Documentation
Documentation is the additional text or illustrated information embedded in the code of software or accompanying it. It helps in the understanding and utilization of the program.

## Why Documentation?
Documentation is critical because it helps to:
- Clarify complex parts of the code.
- Navigate the code easily.
- Describe the use and purpose of various components.

Different types of documentation can be added at different levels of your program:
1. **Inline comments**: These are the brief text descriptions that follow hash symbols throughout the code.
2. **Docstrings**: These are comments on the module and function level. They can either be:
   - One-line docstring: A brief explanation of the function's purpose.
   - Multi-line docstring: If the function is complicated enough to warrant a longer description, you can add a more thorough paragraph after the one-line summary.
   
3. **Project documentation**: Typically contained in a `README.md` file. This includes all packages and details about how the project works to help future contributors and anyone who wants to understand the purpose of the project.

# Automate Clean Code
Two packages can greatly assist in automating clean code:
- `pylint`
- `autopep8`
